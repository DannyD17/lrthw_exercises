 What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

> Reading and writing

> Attention to detail

> Spotting differences


 Please explain these three skills in your own words.

> Reading and writing is essential due to that fact that as a programming you will need to be comfortable reading code
that is being worked on.  Additionally, typing is how code is formed and being skilled at writing will allow better code
to be formulated.

> Attention to detail is one of the things that set apart people who are good from people who are bad at their professions.
While coding the smallest error (such as a slightly misspelled word) can result in bugs or errors that can be difficult to find.

> Spotting differences is a valuable skill that will be used.  When writing code, making errors is inevitable (more so in the
beginning), and being able to spot those areas is necessary. 

 Why do you need to not copy and paste?

> It is important to type in each of the exercises in order to git the practice and muscle memory related to coding.  By typing
it helps train your brain to write code.

 Why is Practice and Persistence important?
 
> Difficulties and challenges will be encountered, it is important to be persistent and practice the code in order to 
overcome these obstacles.  After time (while sticking with it and practicing), you will eventually "get it" when it comes
to those difficult topics.
